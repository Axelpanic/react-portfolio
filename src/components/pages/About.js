        <p> I started working like most people do, I worked for my local stores! Gradually, I began to find a line of work that I liked. This happened to be security work. Beyond patrolling, monitoring cameras, and satifying the client's needs, I began to develop
          a love for computers and modifying its code. I got into raspberry pi linux programing and modifying its uses. Some of the projects I still use today are :Pi-Hole, PlexPi, and Server Pi. These got my mom, a project manager and web designer, to
          tell me about the University of Wisconsin's coding bootcamp.

          At 31 years old, I went from almost 10 years of security experience, 5 years of managment experience, to jump into coding as a career instead of jumping from security job to security job. I am looking for a entry level position as a frontend development
          or full stack developer. You can find out my skills on the deployed page or in the skills page!
